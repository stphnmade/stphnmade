# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Building Blockopoly, a digital card-game inspired by Monopoly Deal (React + TypeScript frontend, Kotlin/Ktor backend, Redis SSE). Iâ€™m also developing Storybot, a Reddit-to-video automation pipeline that uses scraping, AI voiceovers, and FFmpeg to generate short-form content.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to deepen my skills in full-stack architecture, scalable backend systems, data visualization, and cloud deployments.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on connecting to creative services with APIs, tech-meets-storytelling projects.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with best practices for production deployment, cloud hosting, Docker development tricks, and migrating/consolidating past projects accurately from other GitHub profiles [Data project account](https://github.com/stephensyl) , [Fullstack project account](https://github.com/Saparta).
